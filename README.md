## About this Repository
This is my material I worked with for the course Computer Graphics and Animation at the Cologne University of Applied Sciences.  
This Repository contains some older assignments which were solved in 2013/14 with a different professor. I might add the newer assignments as I solve them.  
This file contains everything I learn for the exam and I may want to remember later on. Should there be a problem concerning privacy or copyright feel free to message me: mail [at] christianpoplawski.de.
